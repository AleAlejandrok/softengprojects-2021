Tic-tac-toe Game V1

Running the code requires running of main.java in the cen4010.pa2 package

In this iteration of the tic-tac-toe game, a 3x3 grid is presented to the player and the user must click start to begin the game.
Per classic Tic-tac-toe rules, the player with the starting move is X and the second player is X. 
Currently the only option is to play with a friend side by side and have them share the mouse to make their moves. 
Depending on whose turn it is the player must click an empty square on the grid to place their mark on the board, when 3 in a row or diagnally are placed on the board that player is declared the victor.
To encourage faster play, there are two timers that count down from 30 seconds once the first move is made; if either player runs their timer out and attempts to make a move, they lose.
To play again the players must close the game using their system's close button and re-launch.
In the current iteration there is a drop down for selecting the type of player you match with. Currently only a human player is available.
